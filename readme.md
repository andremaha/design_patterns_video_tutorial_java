# Java Foundation for Design Patterns

In preparation of my [Design Patterns Video Tutorial](https://github.com/andremaha/design_patterns_video_tutorial) I found it easier to explain people how Design Patterns work when showing how they work in different languages. 

And since the [Book](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfdp/) I'm basing my tutorial on is in Java, I've decided to form this repository to support the learning process.
